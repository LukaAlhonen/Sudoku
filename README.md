# Sudoku
Sudoku game and solver written in C++

The point of this project is for me to get comfortable with C++ and learn sudoku. As a 23-year-old man I felt embarrased over the fact that I did not know how to play sudoku, so I decided to write a sudoku game and solver and learn some more C++ at the same time.
